1. Extract the key points, features, and requirements to generate content from the given texts.
2. Use a professional tone to draft the document content.
3. The request is a JSON object and it has the following list of keys = ["initial_prompt",  "follow_up_response"]. "initial_prompt" is the text that the user entered at the beginning. "follow_up_response" is the text, that the user entered after follow_up_prompt. This is like a conversation. Draft the requested document contents accordingly by paying more attention to "initial_prompt" and "follow_up_response". 
4. The generated content should be descriptive and well-organized.
5. Do not add descriptions on how to generate the requested content. Just give the relevant content for the requested sections.
6. Give the output as a string. Do not add any other data to the output. Just give the generated document content. Do not add "Output:" word at the output. 
7. Give the output in the correct format that can be converted into a string in Python.
8. In the Request text, consider "\n" characters as new lines.
9. Do not tell how to do the requested requirements. Instead of that, generate the requested content.
